Project description

In  the  FIRST  project  the  conceptual  work  of  (Klein,  Altuntas,  Kessler,  &  Häusser,  2011)  has 
been  implemented,  extended  and  optimized  leading  to  the  WP4  Semantic  Information Extraction  Components  described  in  FIRST D4.1 and  FIRST  D4.2.  The  latter  presents  the  steps  that  have  been 
accomplished  to  optimize  the  WP4  components  to  noisy  and  uncertain  data.  In  addition, 
deliverable  FIRST D4.3 explains how the WP4 components have been scaled to large scale.
